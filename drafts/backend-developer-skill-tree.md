# Other Notes
- Tough call between picking up Python and JavaScript first (TypeScript, packaing consideratsion)
- Probably cannot get away from some frontend
- Easy to learn too many languages and frameworks
  - Learn one of Python or Type/JavaScript
  - One statically typed garbage collected langauge is enough: if you pick up any of Java, C#, and Go then the others
  - Learn on functional langauge (F# is my first reccomendation)
  - Learn a langauge that requires manual memory management (or Rust)
  aren't the most worthwhile to learn, a lot of line of buisness applications
