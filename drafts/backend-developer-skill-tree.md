# A Rough Backend Developer Skill Tree

Last week an associate software engineer was asking me for advice on the types of side projects that would build
relevant skills in his backend role. In the process I talked through some of the books that I found the most helpful in
getting me to where I am now, and it forms something of a backend 'skill tree'.

## Building Blocks

CSCI 1133 is the first two computer science classes at the Unviersity of Minnesota. [^pedanticism] The first
is an introductory Python class which assumes no prior programming knowledge.

# Other Notes
- Tough call between picking up Python and JavaScript first (TypeScript, packaing consideratsion)
- Probably cannot get away from some frontend
- Easy to learn too many languages and frameworks
  - Learn one of Python or Type/JavaScript
  - One statically typed garbage collected langauge is enough: if you pick up any of Java, C#, and Go then the others
  - Learn on functional langauge (F# is my first reccomendation)
  - Learn a langauge that requires manual memory management (or Rust)
  aren't the most worthwhile to learn, a lot of line of buisness applications
- git/cli/sql: https://vickiboykis.com/2022/01/09/git-sql-cli/

[^pedanticism]: CSCI 1113 taken in place but, well, technicalities
