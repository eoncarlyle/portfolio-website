title: T-Mobile's Fiber Ambitions

US Internet (USI) is a regional ISP based out of Minnetonka, a western suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's primary offering is fiber optic broadband, and its service area is about 2/3rds of Minneapolis and a smattering of her western suburbs. This is a service area of around half a million people, so the company isn't a household name anywhere outside of Minnesota. While few ISPs are well loved, anecdotally USI has a good reputation in Minneapolis, the CEO is known to answer customer support questions in Reddit DMs. Regional fiber ISPs in the midwest don't often attract the attention of the EU's competition authority, but on June 13th the Competition Director-General Oliver Guersent approved the sale of US Internet to T-Mobile US (TMUS) and the Investment Bank KKR holdings. This is one of the fun things about the EU, where because T-Mobile's parent company is based in Germany they have to let competition authorities know about the purchase of a small American ISP months before any of said ISP customers, who were informed in early August of 2025 that they would become T-Mobile customers pending American regulatory approval. USI isn't the only regional ISP coming under TMUS ownership this year - Metronet and Lumos were purchased earlier this year, T-Mobile isn't new to the broadband game given that they already have a fixed-wireless access (FWA) home internet offering, but the 'T-Mobile Fiber' that these ISPs are being rolled into is an entirely new service from T-Mobile.

T-Mobile is, first and foremost, a mobile network operator. So why are they getting into the terrestrial broadband game? This is ultimately pretty predictable given the state of the American mobile network operator market in 2025. At this point, almost everyone who wants cellular broadband can get it. Thanks to the the Cambrian explosion of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) have allowed, this is even true for downmarket segments; it isn't 2010 anymore when vanishingly few American consumers had a smartphone, and many didn't even have a cellphone at all.  Given slow population growth and high smartphone adoption, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile cannot grow the size of the market very much. Getting higher revenue requires increasing average revenue per account (ARPA) and playing 'defense' to maintain your existing customers, and the ISP strategy plays to both of these.[^streaming-economics]

The ARPA impact of running an ISP is pretty clear: when T-Mobile buys a regional ISP, customers that switch their home internet look move more spend to T-Mobile and drive ARPA higher. The churn-fighting part of this is more interesting. Because cellphones fit into pockets, customers can switch carriers without new equipment being installed to their home or buisness. With the advent of eSIMs, it can mean switching without ever _leaving_ the home.  But terrestrial broadband can be higher friction, meaning burying a new cable to get to the customer and installing new equipment in the most involved circumstances. For the vast majority of consumers who think as little as they possibly can about their internet service, remembering that switching their cell carrier will require changing their home internet may convince them to stay with their existing carrier. This sounds a little conspiratorial but it is worth pointing out that there is very little overlap in the metropolitan areas where Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile offer fiber broadband even though all three carriers serve wireless customers essentially everywhere. This is to the benefit of all companies, because there is more friction in switching services if your new mobile carrier and ISP are different companies.

What I am pretty confident in is that this is not some insidious effort to buy out competition and increase prices
- Discuss: small FWA footprint T-Mobile
- Minnesota: concentration not changing much, so pricing power shouldn't either
- Talk FWA numbers from VZ, TMUS
- Admit that Twin Cities ISPs more concentrated than I though

- Justification for buying: high staturation dicatates MNO strategy
 - Accounts * ARPA
 - Accounts: can't increase much, but must fight churn
 - ARPA: How can you increase footprint with customer outside of selling them more service?
 - Terrestrial boradband helps both
 - Talk about Verizon FiOS, AT&T fiber offerings
 - Terrestrial broadband makes a lot of sense for a couple of reasons
 - Rest of T-Mobile Fiber rollout
  - Metronet
  - Lumos Fiber

- Golden Valley address
  - 15 minutes from downtown Minneapolis
  - 10 minutes away from General Mills headquarters
  - Three satelite internet providers, T-Mobile FWA, copper from CenturyLink, and cable from Xfinity


- Note about unchanging concrentration, segmentation between cable + FWA/fiber (those who don't care about speed all that much vs. those who do)
- Minneapolis + western suburb ISP market more concentrated than I thought

[^streaming-economics]: As Ben Thompson often notes, it is also usually cheaper to retain existing customers than pay marketing and sales costs to acquire new ones. I can only imagine that the same is true for large mobile network operators. While MVNOs may have a different customer acquisition profile because of their smaller size, the sheer scale of traditional MNO marketing spend makes this plausible.
