US Internet (USI) is a regional ISP based out of Minnetonka, a western suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's primary offering is fiber optic broadband, and its service area is about 2/3rds of Minneapolis and a smattering of her western suburbs. This is a service area of around half a million people, so the company isn't a household name anywhere outside of Minnesota. While few ISPs are well loved, anecodally USI has a good reputation in Minneapolis - hillariously the CEO responds to Reddit DMs for customer support. For a couple of reasons it isn't the type of company that comes to the attention of the EU's competition authority, but on June 13th the Competition Director-General Oliver Guersent approved the sale of US Internet to T-Mobile US and the Investment Bank KKR holdings. This is one of the fun things about the EU, where beacuse T-Mobile's parent company is based in Germany they have to let competition authorities know about the purchase of a small American ISP months before any of said ISP customers, who were informed in early August of 2025 that starting in September they would become T-Mobile customers pending American regulatory
approval.

- Justification for buying: high staturation dicatates MNO strategy
 - Accounts * ARPA
 - Accounts: can't increase much, but must fight churn
 - ARPA: How can you increase footprint with customer outside of selling them more service?
 - Terrestrial boradband helps both
 - Talk about Verizon FiOS, AT&T fiber offerings
 - Terrestrial broadband makes a lot of sense for a couple of reasons
 - Rest of T-Mobil Fiber rollout
  - Metronet
  - Lumos Fiber


- Note about unchanging concrentration, segmentation between cable + FWA/fiber (those who don't care about speed all that much vs. those who do)
- Minneapolis + western suburb ISP market more concentrated than I thought


> The Bellevue, Washington-based company launched its fiber home internet product June 5, a month after T-Mobile and investment firm EQT acquired High Point, North Carolina-based fiber internet provider Lumos.
