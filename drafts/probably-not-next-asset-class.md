One anecdote that Bryne Hobart is fond of is that when Warren Buffet was getting his start in equity investing most Americans believed that the stock market was a place to bid on livestock. In Hobart's telling, one lesson that Americans took away from the 1929 crash was that equities were scammy nonsense best left entirely alone. Buffet came into the equties investing buisness late enough to have a fresh perspective but early enough where there were still many proverbial $100 bills left on the sidewalk $needAnecdote. This is in part why Hobart argues that the Warren Buffet of the mid 21st century will be someone who gets his start in a new asset class $riffCitationNeeded: while there are still plenty of opportunites in traditional asset classes, getting an opportunity to shoot the fish-in-a-barrell before anyone else is a hard first start to beat.

A boring and good answer to "what asset class is to today what equities were in the early 50's" is 'Cryptocurrencies', but today they may be prominent enough of an asset class to be out of this consideration set. The more interesting answer is perdiction markets, which are in something of a regulatory grey area: many jurisdiction treat perdiction markets more like gambling and less like an above-board financial instrument.[^ctfc-2023] But regulatory burdens aren't the only reason I'm skeptical that perdiction markets could become some grand new asset class; the existing perdiction markets will need to make some changes before they reach maturity.

Breaking down the relevant players in stock exchanges helps bring this point across. I'm leaving out some players for brevity, but the relevant ingredients in a stock exchange are the investors, brokers, market makers, clearinghouses, regulators, investment banks, and of course the exchanges themselves. A given equity is listed on an exchange at a given price, and orders for said equity are placed by investors, intermediated by brokers.  All of the same players are in place for equities options, but margin maintenance becomes more important (as it is for 'vanilla' equity orders) $checkThis.

The most important real-money perdiction market platforms are Polymarket and Kalshi. For the uninitiated, the Wikipedia table of contents for both markets tells you a lot. Polymarket has a 'Legal Issues' section and cannot legally operate in the United States, while Kalshi has 'Regulatory History' - not exactly confidence inspiring, but better than the former. While Kalshi has obtained regulatory approval by the SEC, it has still faced aformentioned regulatory scrutiny for it's markets on political questions $makeMoreExplicit. Given that I know a lot more about Kalshi (and, unlike Polymarket, none of it's executives have been detained by the United States federal government at least as far as I'm aware), I'm going give more focus to Kalshi.

Clearing houses and market makers will be more sophisticated in highlighly liquid centralised exchanges like the NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE, etc. while these roles are carried out directly by broker-dealers in over-the-counter marketplaces: "A Tegus call with a former OTC Markets Group employee notes that there are only about 300 people who actively make markets in these \[OTC\] stocks".[^the-diff-otc] This pales in comparison to highly liquid formal markets with a panopaly of market makers and the sophisticated firms and institutions that enable them. But even as compared to OTC markets, Kalshi is a step reduciton in sophistication. The 'market' in 'Perdiction market' naturally means that the platform takes the role of the exchange, but it also takes the role of a market maker by gaurenteeing liquidity. Because it is the only entity that can list onto the exchange, it takes the role of the investment banks and other market instutitions involved in public offerings. I'd argue that this is something rather different from entites that write options against other securities, as these options require someone else to have brought a security to market for there to even be something to trade.



# Perdiction market listings
- Exchanges and issuers are the same entity
- 'Going to zero'/'going to one' problem
  - Is this an issue? How different is this from out-of-the-money options? (I'm thinking not?)
- Temporary nature
  - I wouldn't think this is an issue: bonds and options already face this


# OTC exchange players
- Investors
- Brokers
- Market makers
- Exchanges
- Clearinghouses
- Regulators
