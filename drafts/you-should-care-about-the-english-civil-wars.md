From Fedralist Paper No. 85:

> These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the states from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from TIME and EXPERIENCE.

It is easy to forget how near the spectre of civil war was to the founding. Conflict between the King Charles I and parliament over both the extent of his powers and the established protestant Church's doctrine in England and Scottland started three English Civil Wars and serveral knock-on conflicts between 1642 and 1652. In English conflicts alone, around 162,000 soldiers died between battle disease at a time when the country had only 5.5 million people - a preportionate death toll exceeding England's losses in the second World War. The second English Civil War culminated in parliament trying and convicting the King of high treason before executing him in front of the palace of Whitehall on Janurary 30th, 1649, leaving England without a king for the first time since before the Norman Conquest.

The English parliament had fought and won a revolutionary war for the right to govern themselves, tossing the English poltical and social hiearchy into disarray. Parliament lauched from one unstable constitution to another before the start of the Commomwealth government in 1653. The Brittish Isles were ruled as a republic with three branches of government with checks and balances, lead by Parlimentary Cavalry commander and the now Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Political stability finally returned after a decade of chaos, but Cromwell's death on September 3rd, 1658 spelled the end to Brittish self rule. Oliver Cromwell's son and successor wasn't nearly as capable at keeping conflicts between Parliament and the army at bay, leading to King Charles II's restoration on May 8th, 1660.

America's founding fathers built an enduring republic, succecceding where their forefathers had failed a century earlier. The conflict is embarassingly underemphasized in American civic education: two decades of chaos that killed hundreds of thousands of people and devestated the lives of many more taught the liberal tradition invavluble lessions in how not to organize society.

# Rule of Law
Even before the boths sides started trying to kill one other, King Charles I and his parliaments never got along. At this point in time parliaments were only elected and called to session at the order of the King. This was almost always in order to grant the King money, money that was almost always used to fight wars. Settled law was that taxes could not be raised without the consent of parliament. When the King called his first parliament [^useless-parliament] in 1625 the House of Commons broke with over a century of tradition and didn't grant the King the authority to collect import tariffs for life. Undettred, the King simply collected the duties anyway until 1641. Unable to make much progress with parliament, the king decided to demand extraparliemntary forced loans to fund the crown:

> ...in 1626 commissioners were appointed to levy the equivalent of five subsidies from everyone who was rated in the subsidy books. To the public at large it was indistinguishable from a large parliamentary grant, except that parliament had not granted it. Financially the Forced Loan was a success because very nearly five subsidies were collected, but seventy-six gentlemen went to prison rather than pay it. (At least fifteen peers also refused to pay, but significantly only one was imprisoned; peers were privileged, even in disobedience.) **Five of the imprisoned refugees launched a cause celebre by taking out writs of habeas corpus, which required the crown to state the reason for their imprisonment; they hoped thereby to bring the legality of the Loan under the judgment of the common law. The judges had collectively declined the king's request to pronounce it legal in advance, and he had sacked the senior Lord Chief Justice in consequence.**

As the plight of the five Knights became something of a _Cause célèbre_, Parliament conditioned any funding to the crown on the 1628 Petition of Right. This document forbade taxation without the consent of parliement, imprisionment without due process, or quartering soldiers in civilian homes without consent. The paralells with Article I, the fifth amendment.[^constitutional-paralells] The King's ascent of the Petition of Right did not prevent further disagrements with Parliament and decieded that the juice was no longer worth the squeeze. From 1629 to 1640 the King did his best to stay out of military engagements that would require funding from parlieament and funding with strings attached. The King and his councilors used every trick in the book to raise money without parliament:

- Monopolies: the king sold patents for companies to have a monopoloy on a given good, relying on a loophole in the 1624 Statute of Monopolies
- Ship money: in wartime the King could raise money to build the navy from coastal counties, but King Charles I raised it from _every_ county during peacetime
- Wardship: if a gentry landlord was a 'tenant-in-chief' landlord and died without an heir, the King was entitled to the rents of the estate and had to be _bought out_ before a succesor could take ownership
- Royal forests: fining people living in the suburbs of London and anywhere else that was technically royal forest at some point in the misty past

It's little wonder that when the King called a parliament in 1640 it would be less than two years before both sides would meet on the battlefield.

But not to be outdone, parliament and later republican governments were more than capable of trampling on the rule of law. In 1638 when war broke out with Scottland, the trusted royal advisor Earl of Strafford helped lead the military response and was convinced that hardliners in Parliament were collaborating with the Scottish rebels. In reponse, the commons accused and tried him for high treason. Extra seating was built in Westminster for the whole public to see how trecherous Strafford was, but representing himself in the impeachment proceedings he mounted an incredibly strong defense. Parliament's star wittness claimed that Strafford was trying to use Irish soldiers to supress English subjects, but every other piece of testimony showed that Strafford was arguing for Irish soldiers to be used for the war in Scottland. Undettered, parliament passed a Bill of Attainder; an act of parliament that could _declare someone guilty of a crime without a trial or jury_. Misteps by the king later that year meant that he longer had the political capital to save his friend and ever expect anything from another parliament, so royal assent of the bill meant that Strafford was publicly executed on May 12th, 1641 in front of a crowd of 100,000 people.

After the second English Civil War, the hardliners Oliver Cromwell and Henry Irenton used similarly shameful tactics to gain power. Infighting in parliament after victory in the first war gave the king an opening to start the second. When he again lost, many moderates in parliament wanted to put him back on the throne under the Treaty of Newport. While parliament in this day was hardly a representative body, it was reasonably representative of the public's view of the king: roughly half of England and Wales supported him over parliament with strong majorities in many parts of the kingdom. Rather than trying to convince their fellow MPs to draw a tougher line with the king, the army marched onto London with Cromwell and Irenton's backing. Allegedly without their knowledge, Colonel Thomas Pride had a list of royalist and moderate MPs to physically bar from parliament. These rightfully elected MPs were prevented from taking their place in parliament until 1659, and the much more pliant chamber made it possible to execute the King and engage in all manner of radical experiments in republican goverment.

Discussion of abuses of power from the revolutionaries would be absent without talking about expropriating land from the Irish. After Cromwell's conquest of Ireland, parliament started the process fo confiscating 2.5 million acres of land from Irish Catholic landlords to give to English soldiers. The act of Parliament that enabled this technically called for the 80,000 Irish people to be executed to make way for the English, but luckily less than 1000 people were executed as part of the disapropriation. The dispossesd Irish from every corner of the island were banished to small plots of land in the relatively barren county of Connaught.

"According to the best evidence we have (and it is imperfect), catholics owned 59 per cent of the land of Ireland on the eve of the rebellion in 1641, and they predominated in all but two counties outside Ulster. By 1688 the proportion had shrunk to 22 per cent"


# Religious Freedom
In England, Wales, and Scottland a strong majority of the population was protestant, and throughout the conflict Catholics were subject to recusancy fines and other forms of persecution. While King Charles I was a devout protestant, his marraige to the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria from France fomented more than a few conspiracies that he was on the cusp of reimposing Catholicsism on the state protestant church. In England, what would become Anglican doctrine was hotly debated between both members of the clergy and the lay public. The purtains of the era argued that the existing episcopal hierarchy of bishops, emphasis sacrements in worship, and ornate churches reeked of residual catholicism that had to be purged. This was a broad social movement where Calvinism was the dominant theology, and their opponents included anti-Calvinists of different stripes, bishops who wanted to preseve their standing, and others who simply wanted to preseve the tradition and sacrements that had been a part of their worship for as long as they could remember.

While the king's unconstitutional taxation was facing opposition throughout England, his heavy-handed approach to the state church ruffled at least as many feathers. As supreme governour of the church, the King appointed many ceramonialist bishops. Few members of the clergy were as staunch supporters of the King as William Laud, whose loyalty was rewarded by his appoitnement to the archishop of Canterburry, the highest office in the Church of England. Laud was staunchly anti-puritain and wasn't shy about using the power of the state to harass his theological enemies. Extrajudicial punishment out of the Star Chamber [^star-chamber] were the order of the day, most notably against three men in 1637 who criticized the episcopal hierarchy in print. As punishment their ears were cut off, they were locked in a pillory, fined £5,000. The shocked crowds treated them as martyrs, draping them in garlands as they made their way to their prisons.

Puritains were not inclined to turn the other cheek once they found political power:

> Clotworthy and his men proceeded to the side chapels, where they broke up two paintings of the Virgin and of St Francis, perhaps the iconoclasts’ least favourite saint. In the vestry, they flung a large statue of the Virgin and Child to the floor, and then smashed the Virgin’s face and the face of her child with feet and then with clubs. The sound of splintering stone spurred them on. In the chapel garden, they found another statue of St Francis, which they also destroyed, and another crucifix, ripe for breaking. The crackling fires that the soldiers lit burned long into the night, consuming shreds of canvas, books, rich embroidered vestments. On Good Friday, the soldiers destroyed some minor masterpieces – Matthew Goodrich’s and Thomas de Critz’s oval ceiling painting of the Assumption of the Virgin, a work even larger than Rubens’s Crucifixion. The remnants not burnt were again flung into the Thames.

"What made all the resentment towards icons and symbols far more intense were the Laudian reforms that had overturned the Church of England in the 1630s. One of Parliament’s main missions was to remedy all this. In Suffolk, William Dowsing led a campaign which destroyed decorations in 150 churches. Dowsing was careful, meticulous, a keeper of long lists and records."
^ Purkiss

"Is brotherly love, and a healing spirit of that force and value amongst us that it ought? ... Do we first search for the kingdom of Christ within us, before we seek one without us? ... Do we not more contend for saints having rule in the world, than over their own hearts? ... Do not some of us affirm ourselves to be the only true ministry, and true churches of Christ, and only to have the ordinances in purity, excluding our brethren, though of equal gifts? ... Do we remember old puritan, or rather primitive simplicity, self-denial, mercy to the poor, uprightness and justice?"

"formal toleration of catholics. He replied that a public declaration granting them full religious freedom was politically impossible, but claimed that they had less cause for complaint under his government than under that of the Long Parliament. He himself, he said, had shown compassion to very many; he had plucked many out of the fire-the raging fire of persecution, which did tyrannize over their consciences, and encroached by an arbitrariness of power over their estates'. He hoped to do more for them as soon as he could remove certain impediments, but in the event his second parliament was to press him in the opposite direction. Nevertheless Bordeaux assured Mazarin that catholic priests were moving freely about London"


Some of Laud's early tyrannies included excommunicating and imprisoning puritains.

## The Blazing World Quotes

By now the war was three years old. It had brought violence, destruction and punishing taxation. By its end, around 62,000 soldiers were dead, and perhaps 100,000 more had died from war-related disease. Some 150 towns had been severely damaged, some set on fire by white-hot cannonballs deliberately designed to enflame timber buildings, and around 10,000 homes had been destroyed. page 202

But all armies, Fairfax’s included, brought a heavy tax burden. Indeed, that burden was now much higher than it had been under Charles’s Personal Rule in the 1630s, with the excise on basic commodities hitting the poor much harder than the rich. In some counties, the level of tax in the 1640s was ten times that of Ship Money in the 1630s. Meanwhile, many soldiers were quartered on civilian houses, and people complained that they would ‘eat the meat out of their children’s mouths’, and then moan about its quality.

Star Chamber was an important arm of the English state. So-called because it convened in a room at Westminster with a star-spangled ceiling, it was partly feared as an instrument of censorship and government terror, and partly respected as a useful tool by which rich provincial thugs could be brought to justice. It was increasingly choked with business too. For this was a litigious age, and Star Chamber’s flexible approach to crime allowed it to hear many novel offences that were much harder to prosecute in the main common-law courts. It also dealt extensively with sedition, riot and particularly those cases where malefactors were using their own influence in the localities to evade justice.

More pain was to come. The ‘Cromwellian’ land settlement was planned by the Westminster Parliament from 1642, legislated by them in 1652 and would be kept in place long after Cromwell died. But without Oliver’s army, it couldn’t have happened. He and his soldiers won the military victories that made it possible. The 1652 act put into place the long-planned confiscation of 2.5 million acres, and – in theory – rendered some 80,000 Irish people liable to capital punishment (the relatively poor were exempted). A court was created to oversee the process, and hundreds of people were executed (though the court had virtually ceased activity by the time Cromwell actually came to power in 1653).

## Britain in Revolution Quotes
When the Long Parliament tried to outlaw the Prayer Book rites and services after the Civil War, it encountered a deep and widespread popular affection for them. Even the bitterly opposed altar rails cannot have been universally unpopular, for many parishes restored them spontaneously on the eve of the Restoration, before the Anglican order was formally reinstated.

The Great Migration to New England coincided almost exactly with the personal rule. Between 16z9 and 1640 about 6o,ooo men, women, and children made the journey, and far more than in the case of Virginia and the other older colonies whole families wound up their affairs in England and sailed to Massachusetts together.

During October Cromwell bombarded Winchester Castle into surrender on the 5th and then moved against Basing House, the strongly fortified mansion of the catholic Marquis of Winchester and a centre of heroic resistance. It had already withstood two sieges, the second lasting three months, but this one lasted only six days before Cromwell's siege guns blew two large breaches in its walls. The marquis, however, refused his summons to surrender, so he had to storm it. He did so with little loss, but the defenders fought almost to the last, and he let his men slaughter many of them, including six priests, before granting quarter to the majority. Since terms had been refused after essential defences had been breached they were not entitled to quarter, and a case could be made for punishing desperate resistance as an example, for the sake of saving soldiers' lives and shortening the war. Nevertheless it can hardly be doubted that Cromwell's uncharacteristic harshness sprang partly from Basing's notoriety as `a nest of idolatrous papists'.

The act did not tackle the really difficult problems of how much land should be confiscated and where, or how it should be distributed between the adventurers and the army in Ireland, but it did decree how the Irish people were to be dealt with. It granted pardon to all 'the inferior sort' who submitted, but with regard to men of substance it defined five categories who were to be excluded from pardon as to life or estate or both, according to their 'respective demerits'. A list of 105, headed by Ormond, were totally excepted by name; the other four excluded groups were all abettors of the rebellion in its early stages, all priests and Jesuits in any way involved in it, all who had murdered civilians, and all who failed to lay down their arms within twenty-eight days. Officers who had fought against the parliament were to be banished and their estates forfeited, though their wives and children were to be given land worth a third of what they had lost in a location to be decided by parliament. Non-belligerent catholics also faced forfeiture unless they had shown `constant good affection' to the parliament, though they were to be compensated elsewhere with land valued at two-thirds of what they surrendered.

The greatest economic injustice, and the heaviest blow to recovery, had been perpetrated by the Long Parliament long before Cromwell became Protector, when it decided not only to exclude Roman Catholics from municipal government and trading guilds but to expel them from all walled towns. Many of the less wealthy just moved out into the suburbs, and some simply evaded the ban, but most of the substantial catholic merchants left the country and settled abroad; St Mato was their favourite refuge. They took with them their ships, their stocks, and their expertise, causing a serious shortage of Irish-based shipping to carry Irish trade, and much urban decay, especially in Cork, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford.

Irishmen who took it were further required to bring up their children to speak only English and conform to the English catechism. Henry deplored this oath of abjuration, which naturally caused great consternation among Irish catholics, but having failed to prevent its extension to Ireland he seems to have made no attempt to impose it. Nor was there any drive to compel catholics to attend the services and receive the sacraments of a church that their consciences rejected, as there had been in Elizabethan and early Stuart England. Priests were officially proscribed; from January 1653 the policy was to banish them on pain of the penalties for high treason if they returned, and perhaps a thousand or more went into exile. But a considerable number returned and led an underground existence among the catholic population, despite a price of £5 on their heads. Those that were caught were commonly transported to the West Indies, but they were not in Henry's time subjected to a traitor's death. The number of Irish martyrs subsequently recommended to Rome for beatification comes to 119, including 22 laymen, for the years 1649-53, and of these 84 suffered in 1651-2; but the toll fell to 2 in 1654 and 3 in 1655, the year of Henry's arrival. There were none thereafter. Tragic though it was that the great majority of the Irish people could not practise their religion openly, Henry was moving in the direction of de facto toleration of discreet catholic worship, and the penal laws throughout the Cromwellian Protectorate were less harsh than they were to be under William III and after.
