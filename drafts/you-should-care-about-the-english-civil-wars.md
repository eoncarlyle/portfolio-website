# You should care about the English Civil Wars


In May 1660, Sir Thomas Fairfax crossed the English Channel with eleven other men to formally invite King Charles II to reclaim the throne. Fifteen years earlier, Fairfax had commanded the army that defeated and deposed Charles's father. What made a successful revolutionary general personally restore the monarchy he'd helped destroy?

The answer teaches us why America's founders succeeded at building an enduring republic where their forefathers had failed. The English Civil Wars are a cautionary tale to the liberal tradition on how strong leadership cannot replace a commitment to the rule of law and strong republican institutions  American civic education criminally ignores this story: two decades of chaos that killed hundreds of thousands of people and devastated the lives of many more taught the liberal tradition invaluable lessons in how not to organize society.

Conflict between King Charles I and parliament over both the extent of his powers and the established protestant Church's doctrine started three English Civil Wars and several knock-on conflicts between 1642 and 1652. The second English Civil War culminated in parliament prosecuting the King for high treason before executing him in front of the palace of Whitehall on January 30th, 1649, leaving England without a king for the first time since before the Norman Conquest: the English parliament had fought and won a revolutionary war for the right to govern themselves.  Parliament stumbled from one failed constitution to another until Fairfax's old second in command, Oliver Cromwell, became Lord Protector in 1653. When Cromwell died in 1658, his eldest son and successor couldn't keep the republic together, leading to King Charles II's restoration on May 8th, 1660.

## Constitutional Breakdown

Even before both sides started trying to kill each other, King Charles I and his parliaments never got along. While parliament only represented the wealthiest property-owning men in the kingdom, settled law was that taxes could not be raised without the consent of parliament: any king without buy-in from wealthy subjects faced an uphill climb to getting anything accomplished

When the King called his first parliament [^useless-parliament] in 1625 the House of Commons broke with over a century of tradition and didn't grant the King the authority to collect import tariffs for life. Undeterred, the King simply collected the duties anyway until 1641. Unable to make much progress with parliament, the king decided to demand extra-parliamentary forced loans to fund the crown. When five knights petitioned for writs of habeas corpus, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench didn't commit to declaring the forced loans legal before the proceedings and was _sacked by the king in response_.

The plight of the five knights meant that parliament conditioned any funding to the crown on the 1628 Petition of Right. This document forbade taxation without the consent of parliament, imprisonment without due process, or quartering soldiers in civilian homes without consent. [^constitutional-paralells] The King's ascent of the Petition of Right did not prevent further disagreements with Parliament and decided that the juice was no longer worth the squeeze. From 1629 to 1640 the King did his best to stay out of military engagements that would require funding from parliament and funding with strings attached. The King and his councillors used every trick in the book to raise money without parliament:

- Monopolies: the king sold patents for companies to have a monopoly on a given good, relying on a loophole in the 1624 Statute of Monopolies
- Ship money: in wartime the King could raise money to build the navy from coastal counties, but King Charles I raised it from _every_ county during peacetime
- Wardship: if a gentry landlord was a 'tenant-in-chief' landlord and died without an heir, the King was entitled to the rents of the estate and had to be _bought out_ before a successor could take ownership
- Royal forests: fining people living in the suburbs of London and anywhere else that was technically royal forest at some point in the misty past

It's little wonder that when the King called a parliament in 1640 it would be less than two years before both sides would meet on the battlefield.

## How Republics Fail

But not to be outdone, parliament and later republican governments were all too willing to run roughshod over the rule of law.

In 1638 when war broke out with Scotland, the trusted royal advisor Earl of Strafford helped lead the military response and was convinced that hardliners in Parliament were collaborating with the Scottish rebels. In response, the commons accused and tried him for high treason. Extra seating was built in Westminster for the whole public to see how treacherous Strafford was, but representing himself in the impeachment proceedings he embarrassed the commons by showing all of England how flimsy their case was. Parliament's star witness claimed that Strafford was trying to use Irish soldiers to suppress English subjects, but every other piece of testimony showed that Strafford was arguing for Irish soldiers to be used for the war in Scotland.

Undeterred, parliament passed a Bill of Attainder; an act of parliament that could _declare someone guilty of a crime without a trial or jury_. Missteps by the king later that year meant that he no longer had the political capital to save his friend and ever expect anything from another parliament, so royal assent of the bill meant that Strafford was publicly executed on May 12th, 1641 in front of a crowd of 100,000 people.

After the second English Civil War, the hardliners Oliver Cromwell and Henry Irenton used similarly shameful tactics to gain power. Infighting in parliament after victory in the first war gave the king an opening to start the second, and when he again lost in 1648, many moderates in parliament wanted to put him back on the throne under the Treaty of Newport. While parliament in this day was hardly a representative body, it was reasonably representative of the public's view of the king: roughly half of England and Wales supported him over parliament, with strong majorities in many parts of the kingdom. Rather than trying to convince their fellow MPs to draw a tougher line with the king, the army marched onto London with Cromwell and Irenton's backing. Allegedly without their knowledge, Colonel Thomas Pride had a list of royalist and moderate MPs to physically bar from parliament: these rightfully elected MPs were prevented from taking their place in parliament for eleven years.

This much more pliant legislature made it possible for Cromwell and his military allies to advance their agenda, but in doing so Cromwell and his military allies weakened both the rule of law and parliament's legitimacy. These the very institutions that Fairfax and Cromwell fought a war to protect, and republican government could not survive without them.

Historians name this parliament the 'rump' parliament on account of it's diminished size, and in January of 1649 it put the King on trial. It wasn't a lawful act of parliament, because it never got the approval from the House of Lords but the commons went along with it anyway. What makes this even more legally dubious is that the commons could not act as a court of law according to any constitution in English history. When Strafford was put to trial, the commons impeached him and the trial was held in the lords but in 1649 the upper house was essentially empty.

The commons may have been more representative of 'the people' in theory, but it too was a husk of it's former self. Not only from it's purged members, but those so disgusted that they stayed away in protest. Representative of England it was not. None other than Fairfax's wife shouted ‘Not half! Not a quarter of the people of England. Oliver Cromwell is a traitor!’ during the proceedings, and envoys from the royal family even tried to get Fairfax to intervene.

After executing the king on January 30th, 1649, the rump parliament had neither a constitution for republican Britain nor much of a plan for putting one into place. By this point, Fairfax had become disillusioned with politics and the place that the revolution had taken Britain. But the chaos would continue:

- April 20, 1653: Oliver Cromwell forcibly dissolves the rump, which had technically been sitting since before the wars in 1640
- July 4: The Barebone's Parliament convened under a new constitution for Britain [^barebones]
- October and November: Barebones Parliament tilts in an increasingly radical direction
- December: Moderates vote to dissolve the body; Oliver Cromwell appointed as Lord Protector and head of state under the first protectorate constitution, the Instrument of Government
- January 22nd, 1655: Cromwell dissolves Parliament early by exploiting a loophole in the Instrument of Government. The constitution required Parliament to sit for five months before dissolution, but didn't specify whether these were calendar months or lunar months. Cromwell counted five lunar months  instead of calendar months, allowing him to end the session weeks earlier than intended.
- May 25, 1657: Instrument of Government replaced with the Humble Petition and Advice
- September 3rd, 1658: Oliver Cromwell dies

Oliver Cromwell was a formidable statesman, and as of 1657 it appeared that republican Britain was on a stable footing: if you squint, the American republic followed a similar trajectory between Cornwallis's surrender and the ratification of the constitution. But the undoing of the republic was that no one else could balance the interests of parliament, the army, and the people. Before his death, he named his eldest son Richard as his successor, but Richard's plans to shrink the size of the army led to him being deposed less than a year later. The only other centre of power in England consisted of a handful of MPs - either the radicals first elected in 1640 who were extreme enough to survive Pride's Purge, or those who won elections to fill the vacated seats. This body just as unpopular as the army it was vying for power with, and with Oliver Cromwell's death, there was no one who could keep the two sides at bay. Parliament voted to dismiss army leadership, and after a two-week stand off in October 1659 the army forcibly dissolved parliament.

At this point, the country went into open revolt. That December General George Monck raised an army in Scotland and marched south not to restore the current parliament but rather to establish order and call for free, general elections for the first time in 20 years. When he heard of Monck's plan, the gout-ridden one-time rebel Fairfax raised troops in York in support. Enough was enough: the time for republican political experimentation was over. The political capital and military power of Monck and his allies was no match for the half-hearted military junta in London. On May 1st, 1660, the newly elected parliament declared that 'the government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords, and Commons' - surprising absolutely no one. Fairfax and the rest of the parliamentary delegation visited the King's exile court in the Dutch city of Breda, and on the King's return London, a one time hotbed of revolution, celebrated for three days straight.

A republic without a commitment to the rule of law and institutions broadly legitimate to the public cannot last, and a constitution built around a once-in-a-generation political talent cannot last. Without civilian control of the military enshrined in Article II of the constitution, every transfer of power is put at risk. And durable self-governing requires stability: otherwise too many people needed to make a republican government work correctly will take their ball and go home

## Religious Disputes

There are also more optimistic lessons to be taken from the conflict. The conflict was an important milestone on the path to religious toleration, but this wasn't imposed by leading enlightenment philosophers but rather an exhausted consensus converted on after everything else had been tried.

In England, Wales, and Scotland a strong majority of the population was protestant, and throughout the conflict Catholics were subject to recusancy fines and other forms of persecution. While King Charles I was a devout protestant, his marriage to the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria from France fomented more than a few conspiracies that he was on the cusp of reimposing Catholicism as the state protestant church. In England, what would become Anglican doctrine was hotly debated between both members of the clergy and the lay public. The puritans of the era argued that the existing episcopal hierarchy of bishops, emphasis on sacraments in worship, and ornate churches reeked of residual Catholicism that had to be purged. This was a broad social movement where Calvinism was the dominant theology, and their opponents included anti-Calvinists of different stripes, bishops who wanted to preserve their standing, and others who simply wanted to preserve the tradition and sacraments that had been a part of their worship for as long as they could remember.

While the king's unconstitutional taxation was facing opposition throughout England, his heavy-handed approach to the state church ruffled at least as many feathers. As supreme governor of the church, the King appointed many ceremonialist bishops. Few members of the clergy were as staunch supporters of the King as William Laud, whose loyalty was rewarded by his appointment to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest office in the Church of England. Laud was staunchly anti-Puritan and wasn't shy about using the power of the state to harass his theological enemies. Extrajudicial punishment out of the Star Chamber [^star-chamber] were the order of the day, most notably against three men in 1637 who criticised the episcopal hierarchy in print. As punishment their ears were cut off, they were locked in a pillory, fined £5,000. The shocked crowds treated them as martyrs, draping them in garlands as they made their way to their prisons. Puritans were not inclined to turn the other cheek when they had the power to do so. An 1643 act of parliament commanded the destruction of altars, icons, and statues, given that prevailing puritan doctrine saw them as idolatrous. Countless religious artefacts - both Catholic and Protestant - were destroyed in this time.

Once armed conflict was coming to a close in England in the 1650s, parliament started stumbling in the direction of religious liberty. The state church was purged of many royalists and parliament tried and failed to ban the raucous Christmas celebrations of the era,[^christmas] but outside of the abolition of bishops there was less enforced puritan doctrine onto the Church of England than may have been expected.

But while the late king was concerned that religious uniformity was necessary to keep his kingdom intact, republican England as the Church morality courts were abolished, and mandatory church attendance was repealed. From _Britain in Revolution_:

> "All who professed faith in God by Jesus Christ were to be free to practise their religion, so long as they did not abuse it to the civil injury of others, or disturb the peace, or invoke it to justify licentiousness. This liberty was not to extend to 'popery or prelacy', but there was a widespread de facto toleration of Anglican \[pre-war ceremonial\] worship throughout the 1650s"

Perhaps most surprisingly, Oliver Cromwell offered assurances that recusancy laws punishing non-protestants wouldn't be enforced on London's Jewish community, which had been underground to the extent it existed at all since the expulsion of all English Jews in 1290. This started a small Jewish migration to London in the 1650s, paving the road to outright legalisation in 1664 after the restoration.

This is all not what many radical puritans wanted in revolutionary Britain. But most of Britain wasn't keen on either Archbishop Laud or doctrinaire Calvinists to use the levers of state power to oppress dissenting views. 'Live and let live', at least for some sects, was chosen out of exhaustion more than anything else.

## Only scratching the surface

Since 1640, we can see how written constitutions protecting individual freedoms from minoritarian and majoritarian tyranny, tolerance across religious sects, and stability after political revolutions have been table stakes for successful liberal democracies; the tyrannies and dramatic revolutionary swings that the American constitution protects us from are not hypotheticals. While the American and French revolutions are more widely discussed, there are few better starting points for modern constitutionalism than this conflict than the English Civil Wars and the political revolution that followed.

In this era, there were very few irredeemably bad or unimpeachably good characters. There were - and still are - real debates about what the wars were fought for, and many important figures switched sides as the events of those decades took on a life of their own. This makes for a fascinating part of history, and it's little wonder that Tyler Cowen insists "you can’t read enough books about 17th century England". There are many fascinating aspects of the story that didn't make it into this post: the formation of the Quakers, communities who believed Acts 4:32 commanded proto-socialist collective ownership, or how the Marquis of Montrose entered Scotland with two men but strung together enough victories to briefly conquer the country.
