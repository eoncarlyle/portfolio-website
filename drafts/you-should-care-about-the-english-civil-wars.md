From Fedralist Paper No. 85:

> These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the union, and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the states from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagogue, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from TIME and EXPERIENCE.

What most American history classes don't emphasise is how near the spectre of civil war was to the founding. Conflict between the King Charles I and parliament over both the extent of his powers and the established protestant Church's doctrine in England and Scottland started three English Civil Wars and serveral knock-on conflicts between 1642 and 1652. In English conflicts alone, around 162,000 soldiers died between battle disease at a time when the country had only 5.5 million people - a preportionate death toll exceeding England's losses in the second World War by. The second English Civil War culminated in parliament trying and convicting the King of high treason before executing him in front of the palace of Whitehall on Janurary 30th, 1649, leaving England without a king for the first time since before the Norman Conquest.

The English parliament had fought and won a revolutionary war for the right to govern themselves, tossing the English poltical and social hiearchy into disarray. Parliament lauched from one unstable constitution to another before the start of the Commomwealth government in 1653. The Brittish Isles were ruled as a republic with three branches of government with checks and balances, lead by Parlimentary Cavalry commander and the now Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Political stability finally returned after a decade of chaos, but Cromwell's death on September 3rd, 1658 spelled the end to Brittish self rule. Oliver Cromwell's son and successor wasn't nearly as capable at keeping conflicts between Parliament and the army at bay, leading to King Charles II's restoration on May 8th, 1660.

America's founding fathers built an enduring republic, succecceding where their forefathers had failed a century earlier. The conflict is embarassingly underemphasized in American civic education: many hundreds of thousands died to teach mankind how to not organise society.

## The Blazing World Quotes

By now the war was three years old. It had brought violence, destruction and punishing taxation. By its end, around 62,000 soldiers were dead, and perhaps 100,000 more had died from war-related disease. Some 150 towns had been severely damaged, some set on fire by white-hot cannonballs deliberately designed to enflame timber buildings, and around 10,000 homes had been destroyed. page 202

But all armies, Fairfax’s included, brought a heavy tax burden. Indeed, that burden was now much higher than it had been under Charles’s Personal Rule in the 1630s, with the excise on basic commodities hitting the poor much harder than the rich. In some counties, the level of tax in the 1640s was ten times that of Ship Money in the 1630s. Meanwhile, many soldiers were quartered on civilian houses, and people complained that they would ‘eat the meat out of their children’s mouths’, and then moan about its quality.[11]

Star Chamber was an important arm of the English state. So-called because it convened in a room at Westminster with a star-spangled ceiling, it was partly feared as an instrument of censorship and government terror, and partly respected as a useful tool by which rich provincial thugs could be brought to justice. It was increasingly choked with business too. For this was a litigious age, and Star Chamber’s flexible approach to crime allowed it to hear many novel offences that were much harder to prosecute in the main common-law courts. It also dealt extensively with sedition, riot and particularly those cases where malefactors were using their own influence in the localities to evade justice.

More pain was to come. The ‘Cromwellian’ land settlement was planned by the Westminster Parliament from 1642, legislated by them in 1652 and would be kept in place long after Cromwell died. But without Oliver’s army, it couldn’t have happened. He and his soldiers won the military victories that made it possible. The 1652 act put into place the long-planned confiscation of 2.5 million acres, and – in theory – rendered some 80,000 Irish people liable to capital punishment (the relatively poor were exempted). A court was created to oversee the process, and hundreds of people were executed (though the court had virtually ceased activity by the time Cromwell actually came to power in 1653).

When the Long Parliament tried to outlaw the Prayer Book rites and services after the Civil War, it encountered a deep and widespread popular affection for them. Even the bitterly opposed altar rails cannot have been universally unpopular, for many parishes restored them spontaneously on the eve of the Restoration, before the Anglican order was formally reinstated.

The Great Migration to New England coincided almost exactly with the personal rule. Between 16z9 and 1640 about 6o,ooo men, women, and children made the journey, and far more than in the case of Virginia and the other older colonies whole families wound up their affairs in England and sailed to Massachusetts together.

During October Cromwell bombarded Winchester Castle into surrender on the 5th and then moved against Basing House, the strongly fortified mansion of the catholic Marquis of Winchester and a centre of heroic resistance. It had already withstood two sieges, the second lasting three months, but this one lasted only six days before Cromwell's siege guns blew two large breaches in its walls. The marquis, however, refused his summons to surrender, so he had to storm it. He did so with little loss, but the defenders fought almost to the last, and he let his men slaughter many of them, including six priests, before granting quarter to the majority. Since terms had been refused after essential defences had been breached they were not entitled to quarter, and a case could be made for punishing desperate resistance as an example, for the sake of saving soldiers' lives and shortening the war. Nevertheless it can hardly be doubted that Cromwell's uncharacteristic harshness sprang partly from Basing's notoriety as `a nest of idolatrous papists'.
