At the American founding, 9 out of 10 Americans lived on a farm but as of 2022, only 1.2% of Americans were employed on
one. Explaining this transition to an intelligent observer in the late 17th century would be incredibly difficult. While
they might not use the words 'mass unemployment', that would definitely be on their minds. But more than anything, they
wouldn't believe that such a small number of people could feed the whole nation. Humanity was just beginning to escape
the Malthusian trap, where any agricultural surplus would be consumed away by a growing population that was at the very
edge of subsistence. There's a reason the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer has three separate prayers for
rain, fair weather, and plenty; it took nearly all of society to feed all of society, and just barely at that.

The resulting story of economic development, initially in the West before diffusing, is one of technological advances
increasing farm productivity. Farming equipment, artificial fertilisers, and pesticides [^1] mean that a bad wheat
harvest likely won't be noticed by much of society. The amount that a single farmer could produce skyrocketed. But why
_didn't_ we face mass unemployment?

Brad DeLong's "Slouching Towards Utopia" gives some clues:

> Four percent of Americans had flush toilets at home in 1870; 20 percent had them in 1920, 71 percent in 1950, and 96
> percent in 1970. No American had a landline telephone in 1880; 28 percent had one in 1914, 62 percent in 1950, and 87
> percent in 1970. Eighteen percent of Americans had electric power in 1913; 94 percent had it by 1950.

In nations that reached escape velocity from the Malthusian trap, expectations were rising for standards of living. If a
nation could routinely produce enough food to sustain itself, it could start to bring more and more consumer goods to
the masses. But manufacturing these goods required the human labor that mechanising agriculture had freed up. Before the
kinks had been worked out, it was beyond the capability of the late 19th century American economy to provide
automobiles, indoor plumbing, home telephones, or electricity to anyone more than a privileged few. But the story of
mechanised agriculture repeated itself. Manfuacturing labor became incrementally more productive, which made manfactured
consumer goods in reach of more people. In response the standard of living expectations rose to meet the new
capabilities of a developing economy.

There's no law of physics that requires economic development to take this path. You could certainly set up a society
that maintains a 19th century standard of living and doesn't place the required resources into either manufacturing
consumer goods or creating something of value to trade for others for said goods, but very few human societies don't
make this choice. Humans seem to have no intrinsic limitations to their wants; our expectations expand to fill our
ability to meet them. But the goods and services at the very frontier of what an economy is able to produce will be more
labour intensive, so technological frontiers change what the newly labor intensive industry is.

Many rich countries struggled with the transition to more service dominated economies. International trade complicates
this story, but only somewhat: regardless of which country the manufacturing was done in, manufacturing productivity
directionally reduces manufacturing employment, but in response the rising expectations of rich-world consumers mean
higher demand for services that are at the frontier of what the economy can support. Put another way, as hard as it
would be to explain to someone from the late 18th century how few people work on farms in 21st century America, it would
be even harder to explain to them how almost 11 million Americans were employed in an industry that the federal Bureau
of Labor statistics describes as 'Professional, scientific, and technical services'. Or over 23 million in 'healthcare
and social assistance; private', let alone nearly 3 million in 'Information'.

This is ultimately what makes me skeptical that this decade's dizzying advancements in artificial intelligence will
result in mass unemployment. It will certainly be an adjustment, and likely a painful one for many industries. But if
our past record is anything to go off of, insatiable human wants will adjust for the productivity savings and we will
move on to other labor-intensive wants that are at the frontier of what we can produce.
