# Iain's Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website available on [iainschmitt.com](https://iainschmitt.com), where I have both ways to review my work and write the occasional post.
It is an F# application running on .NET Core 8 using the Giraffe framework, and it is deployed using GitHub Actions to my home server but hosted behind a public cloud reverse proxy.
