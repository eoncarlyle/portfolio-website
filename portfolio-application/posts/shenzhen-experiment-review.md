# Review of _The Shenzhen Experiment_

For all the attention paid to America's semiconductor reliance on Taiwan and the military consequences of selling
advance Nvidia GPUs to China, I've found it unusual how comparatively little effort has been placed in coming up with an
alternative to the Shenzhen manufacturing ecosystem. Before reading _The Shenzhen Experiment_ I didn't know much about
this region in south China other than that it is responsible for a staggering amount of the worldwide electronics
manufacturing output. This Christmas I received Juan Du's _The Shenzhen Experiment: The story of China's instant city_,
while the book didn't explain as much as I had hoped about electronics manufacturing it is nonetheless excellent.

## A Twisting Road to Market Liberalisation

In the late 1970s, Guangdong province officials wanted greater autonomy from the Chinese party-state to attract
exporting industries and foreign direct investment. Their wish was granted on July 19th, 1979 when the party Central
Committee authorised what would become Shenzhen's special economic zone (SEZ); a mostly rural strip of land a little
smaller than California's Orange County home to about 358,000 people at the time. After Mao Zedong's death, many party
leaders were eager to roll back Mao era economic centralisation to increase economic growth in the country.[^dikötter]
This culminated in Deng Xiaoping's rise to power in 1978, who is more responsible than any other Chinese leader for the
impressive economic growth of the country starting in the early 1980s. The political and economic autonomy granted to
the SEZ made it something of a laboratory of liberalising economic reforms; if reforms worked in Shenzhen they'd be
applied to the rest of the nation.

Because of this, "China's first" is a phrase that comes up a lot in _The Shenzhen Experiment_. This includes:

- First post-communist at-will employment in 1980
- First Sino-foreign joint venture in 1981
- First city to open up construction market through competitive bidding in 1982
- The first to abolish food ration coupons in 1984
- China's first city to offer legal status to rural migrant workers in 1984
- The first public land auction in 1987, later resulting in a constitutional amendment legalising land transfers
- The first international land auction in 1992

These firsts led to the 1980s Shenzhen construction boom: in 1985 over 10 million m<sup>2</sup> of floor area was under
construction, and as of 1987 there were 62 towers taller than 100m in the SEZ. Despite providing political cover for the
SEZ and championing liberalisation in general, Deng Xiaoping only visited the city twice in his lifetime. In his first
visit to the city during the height of the construction boom in 1984, he said the following:

> This time I went to Shenzhen to take a look; the impression it gave me was one of widespread prosperity and growth.
> The construction speed of Shenzhen is very fast, building one floor every few days and a tall building in no time. The
> construction crews there are even from the inland provinces. One reason for the high efficiency is the contract system
> and fairness in administering reward and punishment. Shenzhen's Shekou Industrial Zone is even faster. The reason is
> they were given a bit of power. They can make their own decisions on expenditure under five million US dollars.

However, many in the party were sceptical about both liberalisation in general and the SEZ's success in particular.
While an impressive amount of construction was going on, not much growth was coming from exports and FDI but rather from
other provinces and SOEs propping up. In 1985 vice premier Yao Yilin remarked "It is impossible for the SEZ's economic
development to rely on the country's long-term 'blood transfusion'; now, the 'needle' must be unplugged decisively".
Outside observers from Hong Kong noted that the majority of the SEZ's revenue came from infrastructure and speculative
real estate development. Worse yet to the central government, importers were a substantial part of the non-construction
economy[^sice]; all in all it was a convenient talking point to those who saw SEZ reforms as betraying the basic
principles of the Party. The political blowback was swift, and lead to the suspension of 804 infrastructure projects,
hotel occupancy dropping 20%, and widespread unemployment in the construction sector.

This may have been the end of the Shenzhen experiment if it were not for changes in the foreign-exchange market. The
Hong Kong dollar weakened against both the Japanese Yen and the Taiwanese Dollar, so Hong Kong looked north of the
border for manufactured goods in 1986. Shenzhen's manufactures were moving up the value chain, aided both by the market
reforms and investment in infrastructure, so by 1987 the city was meeting the ambitious production and revenue targets
of the central government. Industrial production kept outpacing construction as an economic driver of the SEZ, leading
to the 1988 conversion of state-owned enterprises into shareholding cooperatives and constitutional changes to recognise
private enterprise.

## Accidental and Contingent Success
- Original justification: immigration & diaspora networks
- Amount of emigration from Hong Kong, income disparity, porous bordere
- Diaspora & HK large amount of success
- Wildly underestimated population growth, looked the other way
- Other SEZs not as succesful

Mao era rule of China was an abject tragedy, as outlined in Frank Dikötter's "The Tragedy of Liberation", "Mao’s Great
Famine", and "The Cultural Revolution", all published by Bloomsbury Press

Yuxi Liu's 'Structure and Interpretation of the Chinese Economy' explains how important getting foreign currency into
the country was at this stage of China's development, so a large import sector was doubly bad news. As an aside, if you
name an essay 'Structure and Interpretation of \$topic' as a nod to Abelson and Sussman's seminal functional programming
textbook, it better be good explanation of \$topic. Luckily the essay lives up to the name.
